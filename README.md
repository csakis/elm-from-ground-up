# elm-from-ground-up

Welcome to Razoyo's Elm learning lab. The approach of this lab is to start with the most basic possible Elm hello world and build to use more and more features of the language progressively.

The idea is that you can start playing with a limited set of features and gradually add more data types and functionality as you progress.

## Lab 11 - Using Dict
We're just scratching the surface here with the Dict data type, but, you'll see that it allows us to do some things that are very handy including using the key to add, remove, or update values, among others. There are a lot of reasons why dict is handy, but, you have to treat it differently. It does have some of the same methods as list like map, but, it's purpose is different.


## How to use the lab

The lab is organized in numbered, step-wise versions. We recommend cloning the repository onto your development environment and check out each numbered branch successively.

To run the demo simply run `elm reactor` from the project root and navigate to src/Main.elm.

## Contributing

Feel free to submit pull requests. We will attempt to review and either comment on them or merge them in a relatively timely manner. The repository is managed by volunteers with day jobs, so, please be patient.

To report bugs or request feature enhancements, just open up an issue.

Happy Elming!
