This branch of the lab is about as basic as they come. My goal was to create a "Hello World" application that does just one thing: display the words "Hello World". The model is a simple string and there are no HTML elements, just text.

#Background
Welcome to Razoyo's Elm learning lab. The approach of this lab is to start with the most basic possible Elm hello world and build to use more and more features of the language progressively.

The idea is that you can start playing with a limited set of features and gradually add more data types and functionality as you progress.

## How to use the lab

The lab is organized in numbered, step-wise versions. We recommend cloning the repository onto your development environment and check out each numbered branch successively.

To run the demo simply run `elm reactor` from the project root and navigate to src/Main.elm.

## Contributing

Feel free to submit pull requests. We will attempt to review and either comment on them or merge them in a relatively timely manner. The repository is managed by volunteers with day jobs, so, please be patient.

To report bugs or request feature enhancements, just open up an issue.

Happy Elming!
